# Java Assembly Language Translator

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a Java-based **Assembly Language Translator** that reads a custom assembly source file, parses its instructions, validates syntax, and outputs the equivalent machine code.

It consists of two main classes:
- **Assembly.java** â†’ Handles the main execution flow, input reading, and output writing.
- **Translator.java** â†’ Contains the translation logic from assembly instructions to binary machine code.
