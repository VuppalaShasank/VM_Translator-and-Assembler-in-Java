# Java Assembly Language Translator

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Java-based **Assembly Language Translator** that reads a custom assembly source file, parses its instructions, validates syntax, and outputs the equivalent machine code.

It consists of two main classes:
- **Assembly.java** → Handles the main execution flow, input reading, and output writing.
- **Translator.java** → Contains the translation logic from assembly instructions to binary machine code.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Parse custom assembly language instructions.
- Convert to machine-readable binary format.
- Validate syntax and detect errors in the input file.
- Simple, extensible architecture for adding new instructions.
- Command-line interface for ease of use.
